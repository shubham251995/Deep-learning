# MNIST Classification and XOR Problem

## Overview
This project involves the development, evaluation, and comparison of various classification algorithms for the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. Additionally, it includes the creation of a neural network from scratch to solve the XOR problem.

## Dataset Description
The MNIST dataset used in this project is a simplified version, consisting of 2707 images of handwritten digits, each represented as a 16x16 (256 pixels) resolution vector. The dataset is divided into training and validation sets, each with their corresponding labels.

## Tasks and Methods
### MNIST Classification
- **Distance-based Classifiers**: Implemented methods to visualize high-dimensional data and applied dimensionality reduction techniques.
- **Multi-class Perceptron**: Developed a single-layer perceptron network for linear classification of digits, with each neuron learning to classify one of the ten digits.

### XOR Problem
- **Neural Network from Scratch**: Created a neural network to solve the XOR problem, focusing on understanding and applying the gradient descent algorithm.

## Key Results
- Achieved promising classification scores for individual digits using the perceptron model.
- Identified challenges in multi-class classification, leading to adjustments in the activation function to improve accuracy.
- Successfully implemented and demonstrated the XOR problem solution using a basic neural network model.
